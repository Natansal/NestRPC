# NestRPC Client (WIP)

Client-side helpers for calling NestRPC routers over HTTP will live here. Planned features:

- Type-safe client generation from router metadata
- Query/Mutation helpers with transport adapters (fetch/axios)
- Context injection hooks

For now, see `packages/server` for server-side usage.
